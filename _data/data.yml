    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        Data analysis and intelligent algorithms have the potential to reshape our entire society. However, most Data Scientists
        start their carreers in Computer Science, Mathematics or Physics. While those subjects provide excellent foundations for the
        skills needed as a Data Scientist, many problems in Politics, Media and Social Sciences require tailor-made solutions based
        on both, Data Science and domain knowledge. Combining a Bachelor's degree in Politics and Public Administration with Master
        studies in Data Science, I am committed to filling this gap.

education:
    - studies: Mannheim Master in Data Science
      university: University of Mannheim
      time: 2017 - Present
      details: |
        From September 2017 on, I've been enrolled in the 
        [Mannheim Master in Data Science](https://www.wim.uni-mannheim.de/en/the-school/degree-programs/msc-in-data-science/) 
        at the [Universtiy of Mannheim, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Mannheim). Designed to be an interdisciplinary programme, the Mannheim Master in Data Science
        offers a broad range of lectures from different academic fields such as computer science, mathematics and quantitative social
        sciences. The focus areas of my personal curriculum include:

          - Data Minig, Data Acquisition and Visualisation
          - Text Analytics
          - IT Security
        

    - degree: BA in Politics and Public Administration
      university: University of Konstanz
      time: 2013 - 2017
      details: |
        Being one of Germany's youngest universities, the [University of Konstanz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Konstanz)
        takes a rather different approach when it comes to teaching political sciences: Statistics, economics, management and public law
        form just as much part of the [BA in Politics and Public Administration](https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/en/studies/bachelor/bapolver/) as standard political theroy. 
        My electives included:
        
          - Survey Statistics
          - Digital Trace Data Analysis
          - Quantitative Methods of Social Sciences

      details: |
        As a Data Scientist working for the German public broadcaster SWR, my job is to support investigative journalism
        by the means of data analysis, data visualisation and other computer-based methods. In particluar, this includes

          - Adaption of machine learning algorithms for journalistic research
          - Setup and design of Data Pipelines
          - Visualisation of findings for publishing and broadcasting
          
        Furthermore, I provide training in data analysis and statistical programming to editorial staff interested in data-driven journalism.

      company: otto group, Hamburg
      details: |
        As an intern in knowledge management I was involved in the establishment, evaluation and measurement of information and experience
        exchange between the individual group companies. This was facilitated by
        
          - Monitoring and analysing intranet traffic
          - Evaluation of survey data
          - Hosting and organising corporate-wide meetups

        representatives to Bundestag and Bundesrat. During my internship, I was assigned to the press office and the state ministry of science,
        research and arts. My tasks included

          - Creating reports on meetings of parliamentary committees
